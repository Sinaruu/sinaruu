## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Egor, but I'm going to Sinaruu online. I am currently studying Computer Engineering in college and am very passionate about programming in various languages (but mostly in Java, though!).

This profile will store my best projects at the time, and I hope you can find something inspiring for yourself if you are also studying programming.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or critiques.
